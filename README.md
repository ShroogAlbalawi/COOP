# Python Basics

## 1. Numbers
In Python, numbers are used to represent values that can be operated on mathematically. There are two primary types: integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`).

## 2. Strings
Strings are sequences of characters used to store text. In Python, strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

### Type Conversion
Type conversion refers to changing the data type of a value, such as converting a string to an integer or a float to a string.

### Methods that can be used on Strings
Strings in Python come with a variety of built-in methods for manipulation, such as converting case, trimming whitespace, or checking if the string contains certain characters.

### String Concatenation
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together using the `+` operator.

### Format - Strings
String formatting allows for the insertion of values into a string at specific placeholders using either f-strings or the `format()` method.

## 3. Booleans
Booleans represent truth values. A Boolean variable can be either `True` or `False`. They are often used in conditions and control flow statements.

## 4. Lists
Lists are ordered collections that can hold multiple items. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.

### Nested List
A nested list is a list within another list. Lists can contain other lists as elements, creating multi-dimensional structures.

## 5. Tuple
A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning its contents cannot be changed once defined.

### Change Tuple Values
Since tuples are immutable, their values cannot be modified directly. To change a value, you need to convert the tuple to a list, modify the list, and then convert it back to a tuple.

## 6. Set
A set is an unordered collection of unique items. Sets do not allow duplicate elements and do not maintain the order of items.

## 7. Dictionary
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are useful for storing related data, such as properties or attributes of an object.
